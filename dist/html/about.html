    <h2 class="sm-heading"><span class="text-secondary">Professional Career</span></h2>
    <p>I started as an IT contractor picking up odd jobs on Craigslist while attending University. I worked for Geek
      Squad as a seasonal Field Service Implementation Engineer helping other technicians
      perform on-site Wi-Fi troubleshooting, performing cable runs, and TV installations. </p>

    <p>As my contract with Geek Squad was winding down, I found a great position with Whitaker Parking Systems. During
      my tenure there, I worked heavily on RFID(HID) and remote computerized access control systems, ensuring PCI-DSS
      compliance of POS/POF devices, electro-mechanical Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) troubleshooting, and
      legacy RS232 serial-to-ethernet low-voltage communications integration for VOIP(Commend) devices. While I was an
      Amano-McGann Parking Systems Technician I had an opportunity to take a contract position with Amazon Web
      Services. </p>

    <p>I excelled in my new Data Center Operations role and was brought on full-time. After demonstrating my ability
      to quickly resolve complicated hardware tickets, Linux OS/firmware issues, document my resolutions and
      disseminate them via the online repo I was promoted to DCO Lead Technician/Support Engineer. This role required
      a variety of skills from technical escalation point for 20 junior DCO technicians across 3 Data Centers,
      liaising with external vendors deploying new infrastructure, remediation of enterprise level networking
      equipment, becoming the USA-East training curriculum designer for Data Center Operations in Dulles, VA., and
      SOP/MOP creation to limit blast radius for external Fortune 500 clients operating on cloud infrastructure.</p>

    <h2 class="sm-heading"><span class="text-secondary">Hobbies</span></h2>
    <p>I have a variety of hobbies including forcing Windows to run Linux, programming, scripting, DevOps, Dockerizing
      host migrations, Cisco networking, and all things Linux(but preferably RHEL/CentOS). Lately I've been trying to
      automate any task I can find. I also golf when I can pull my self out of the shell.</p>

    <h2 class="sm-heading"><span class="text-secondary">Education and Certifications</span></h2>
    <p>I attended Temple University for Computer Science and I'm an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner </p>
